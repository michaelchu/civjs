# CivJS Documentation

Welcome to the CivJS technical and user documentation. This directory contains comprehensive guides for understanding, using, and contributing to the CivJS civilization game.

## üìö Documentation Overview

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technical Guides

- **[Turn Resolution Architecture](turn-resolution-architecture.md)** - Complete technical architecture for the synchronous turn resolution system with Edge Functions and SSE streaming
- **[API Turn Resolution](api-turn-resolution.md)** - Detailed API documentation for the turn resolution endpoint, request/response formats, and integration guide

### üë• User Guides

- **[Turn Resolution Guide](turn-resolution-guide.md)** - User-friendly guide explaining how the turn system works, what to expect during turn processing, and troubleshooting tips

## üöÄ Quick Start

If you're new to CivJS development:

1. Read the [main README](../README.md) for project setup
2. Check [Turn Resolution Architecture](turn-resolution-architecture.md) for system overview
3. Use [API Turn Resolution](api-turn-resolution.md) for implementation details

If you're a player looking to understand the game:

1. Start with [Turn Resolution Guide](turn-resolution-guide.md)
2. Check the troubleshooting sections for common issues

## üéØ Key Features Documented

### Synchronous Turn Resolution
- **Batch Processing**: All player actions processed together
- **SSE Streaming**: Real-time progress updates during turn processing  
- **Edge Functions**: Scalable serverless execution on Vercel
- **Atomic Transactions**: All actions succeed or fail together
- **Rich UX**: Progress indicators, stage descriptions, and error handling

### Technical Implementation  
- **Action Queuing**: Client-side action buffering system
- **Version Control**: Turn version checking to prevent conflicts
- **Idempotency**: Safe request retries with duplicate detection
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes and recovery strategies
- **Performance**: Optimized for single-player games with AI opponents

## üìã Documentation Standards

### Technical Documentation
- Include code examples with TypeScript interfaces
- Provide sequence diagrams for complex flows
- Document error conditions and recovery strategies  
- Include performance characteristics and monitoring

### User Documentation
- Use clear, non-technical language
- Include visual progress indicators and status descriptions
- Provide troubleshooting sections for common issues
- Include tips for optimal experience

## üîÑ Recent Updates

### v1.2.0 - Synchronous Turn Resolution
