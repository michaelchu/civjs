## Detailed Implementation

### 1. Climate Zone System

**File**: `apps/server/src/game/map/IslandGenerator.ts:46-53`

```typescript
export enum ClimateZone {
  POLAR = 'polar',        // Frozen/tundra regions
  TEMPERATE = 'temperate', // Moderate climate  
  SUBTROPICAL = 'subtropical', // Warm but not tropical
  TROPICAL = 'tropical',   // Hot humid regions
  DESERT = 'desert',      // Hot dry regions
  BOREAL = 'boreal'       // Cold forests
}
```

**Reference**: Enhanced from freeciv climate classification logic  
**Location**: `apps/server/src/game/map/IslandGenerator.ts:1047-1076`

### 2. Climate-Aware Terrain Selection

**Enhancement**: `apps/server/src/game/map/IslandGenerator.ts:254-397`

Added climate-specific terrain lists:
- `polarTerrains[]` - Tundra, snow, glacier terrains
- `temperateTerrains[]` - Balanced grassland, plains, forest mix  
- `tropicalTerrains[]` - Jungle, swamp, tropical grassland
- `desertTerrains[]` - Desert, arid plains, dry hills

**Reference**: `freeciv/server/generator/mapgen.c:2013-2069`

### 3. Enhanced Terrain Distribution Logic

**Location**: `apps/server/src/game/map/IslandGenerator.ts:741-824`

Key improvements:
- Climate zone detection for each tile position
- Biome weight calculation based on climate compatibility
- Terrain list blending with environmental considerations  
- Enhanced condition checking with climate zone validation

```typescript
// Enhanced climate-based terrain selection
const climateZone = this.classifyClimateZone(x, y, tiles[x][y]);
const biomeWeights = this.getBiomeWeights(climateZone);
const climateTerrainList = this.getClimateTerrainList(climateZone);

// Blend original terrain list with climate-appropriate terrains
const blendedList = this.blendTerrainLists(terrainList, climateTerrainList, biomeWeights);
```

### 4. Terrain Transition Smoothing

**Location**: `apps/server/src/game/map/IslandGenerator.ts:1192-1280`

Smoothing features:
- Neighbor zone analysis within configurable radius
- Transition terrain selection based on climate boundaries
- Probability-based terrain replacement for natural transitions
- Edge case handling for climate zone boundaries

**Reference**: Enhanced from freeciv smoothing algorithms

## Performance Considerations

### Computational Efficiency
- Climate classification: O(1) per tile with pre-computed maps
- Biome weight calculation: O(1) lookup by climate zone
